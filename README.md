  This project's goal is the implementation of multidimensional data structures and their experimental evaluation with  real data sets in the basic operations: build, insert, delete, update, search (similarity, kNN, interval, stabbing, 3-sided..etc) queries. 
  We implemented k-d trees, quad trees, Range Trees and R-trees, indexing a set of texts generated by computer science scientists https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_computer_scientists of the form:(Surname:String, #Awards:Integer, Education:text-vector). More specifically, the index was generated with respect to the first 2 fields (surname, #awards) in order to identify scientists whose name belongs alphabetically to a range of values and the number of awards they have received is greater than a user_defined threshold. Then, in the text set resulting from the above index, we performed similarity queries on the third field (education) describing the education received by each of these scientists based on the LSH method. E.g. consider queries of the form: “Find computer science scientists from Wikipedia with an education similarity rate of >60%, whose letter belongs to the interval [A, G] and who have received 4 awards”. We also compared experimentally the 4 methods: k-d + LSH, Quad+LSH, Range+LSH, R-trees + LS
